##### Notes on Apache Kafka study
* Nice Blog to kick start: https://medium.com/better-programming/apache-kafka-in-action-6e19836c9d7b
    * Sequence of steps described:
        * start a zookeeper (with default property)
        * start a kafka broker 
        * start a topic
        * start a produce
        * start a consumer
        
    * A demonstration is provided for a scenario where in which consumer abruptly restarts but successfully is able to read all the messages from beginning.
